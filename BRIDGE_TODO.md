 1. Abutment width different from deck width
 2. Reintroduce deck slope
 3. X-skewness in deck and abutments
 4. More freedom when placing piles on abutment pile cap's
 5. Abutment transversal wall: different thickness above and below girder
 6. Approach slab: add inverted beam at abutment-span interface
 7. Approach slab: add beam along free edge (should we? -- engineering decision)
 8. Abutment pile cap should be able to extend beyond transversal wall into span
 9. Introduce load cases for design
10. Move load train sideways on deck
